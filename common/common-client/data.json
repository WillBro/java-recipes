Veterans can also connect with fellow heroes in our very own \"social media\" platform built into The Edge.\r\nWith the completed profile, veterans then have the ability to create unique college-filters to search for schools (based on institution size, geographic location, cost, veteran services provided, etc.). Based on the results of the search, the user has the opportunity to then send their electronic-profiles directly to the institutions admissions and veteran affairs offices to begin two-way communication. \r\nThe Edge also allows for colleges and universities, who are looking to recruit veterans to their respected institutions, the chance to acitvely search and connect with individuals on HFA's database.",

It uses innovative slit position and width and hyperbolic intake and exhaust designs to more than double the ambient wind speeds. This increase makes economically feasible wind power in low wind environments (sub-class 4) possible.\r\nThe Windmill Is environmentally friendly as it does not harm birds or other flying animals.  It is more aesthetically pleasing than conventional wind mills since it does not have exposed rotating blades. It can be manufactured from recycled materials and has low noise unlike a large wind mill which produces the disturbing low frequency noise (the so-called \u201cWHOOOSH\u201d sound) from the rotating blades.  It has a small footprint and very few moving parts.\r\n\r\nFlow simulations on our initial design project a 2.6X increase of ambient wind velocity, making efficient energy capture feasible even in low wind velocity regions.

The physical shopping experience doesn't give shoppers the volume of product information as does the web.\n\nVirtual, 3D shopping brings the social interactivity, fullness and depth of the physical shopping experience into a live, visually stimulating 3D environment. It surpasses the physical shopping experience in efficiency of product display and product information. \n\nWe are upgrading our existing technology to include a template system for the efficient creation of virtual, 3D retail stores.  We will sell major retailers customized 3D stores that can be accessed from their existing websites.  \n\nWe will port our existing 3D mall into a browser-based platform that will support all computers and tablets, offering retailers space and traffic in malls representing major cities world-wide as well as specialty malls (fashion, home improvement, etc.)",
